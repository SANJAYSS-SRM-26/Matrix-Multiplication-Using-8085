Matrix Multiplication in 8085 Assembly Language
This repository contains an implementation of matrix multiplication using 8085 assembly language. The 8085 is an 8-bit microprocessor introduced by Intel in the mid-1970s, and this project demonstrates how matrix operations can be performed on this architecture.

Features:-
Matrix Multiplication Algorithm: The repository includes an optimized algorithm for multiplying matrices written specifically in 8085 assembly language.

Input/Output Handling:- Code segments for handling matrix input and output, making it user-friendly and easy to understand.

Efficiency and Optimization:- Emphasis on optimizing the code for performance within the limitations of the 8085 architecture.

Comments and Documentation:- Detailed comments and documentation are provided within the code to aid understanding and modification.

Usage:-
To use this code:

Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/MatrixMultiplication-8085.git
Assemble and Run: Use an 8085 assembler and simulator to assemble and run the code.
Input Matrices: Input your matrices or modify the existing input to perform matrix multiplication.
View Results: Check the output to see the result of the matrix multiplication.
